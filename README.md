# Elastic-wave-dispersion-in-nanowires

The program is designed to solve dispersion equations for torsional, longitudinal and flexural waves in rods in order to obtain a family of dispersion relations for phonons in nanowires. The algorithm for finding dispersion curves for elastic waves of different polarization is based on finding the roots of nonlinear Pochhammer-Kree frequency equations, containing Bessel special functions, as well as a sequential transition between the real and imaginary domains of arguments. The final result of the program is elastic dispersion relations for phonons of different polarization in thin filaments, as well as their derivatives: group and phase velocities, as well as the density of states function.
